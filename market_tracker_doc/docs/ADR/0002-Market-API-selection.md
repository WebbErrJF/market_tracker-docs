## Context
> According to the assumptions, the application will operate based on stock market data. Therefore, it is necessary to provide these data through an API from a reliable source that possesses such data.

Business requirements:
> 1. Availability of stock market data: The API should provide real-time data on stocks, including prices, volume, percentage changes, etc.
> 2. Free usage: The API should be available for use without requiring a subscription or any fees, allowing users to utilize it at no cost.
> 3. Documentation: The API should be well-described in its documentation, which should include detailed information about available endpoints, parameters, request and response formats, as well as instructions regarding authentication (if required).
> 4. Filtering by date: The API should allow filtering of stock market data based on a date range. Users should be able to specify a start and end date to retrieve data only from the selected period.
> 5. Response format: The API should return responses in JSON format.
